                Hello! My name is Macee Qi. I recently graduated with a 
                Master's degree in Computer Science from Northeastern University. 
                I'm passionate about leveraging data and technology to build products 
                and solutions to real-world problems. I'm looking forward to seeing 
                how I can add value to your team!

            <div className="fs-5 fw-medium">
                Outside of work, I enjoy cooking, 
                running, traveling, spending time with family,
                and learning about ancient history.
